        <h2>Working Principle of a Compound Microscope </h2>
       
        <p>Optical system of a microscope includes 
          <ol>
            <li>Objective lens</li>
            <li>Eyepieces</li>
          </ol> 
          During observation, specimen (object) is placed near the focal plane of the objective lens and a 
          magnified real image of the specimen is first created near the focal plane of the eyepiece. 
          Eyepiece then acts as a magnifier to further magnify the image. Finally a magnified, virtual, inverted image is seen by the observer.

      <h2>Magnification of a Microscope</h2>
      <p>In a microscope, each lens produces a magnification that multiplies the height of the image 
        (enlarges the image). It is apparent that the overall magnification, \(m\) of the microscope is
        the product of the individual <a href="https://openstax.org/books/college-physics/pages/26-4-microscopes">magnifications</a>:
        $$ m = m_{o}m_{e} $$

        where \(m_{o} \) is the magnification of the objective and \(m_{e} \) is the 
        magnification of the eyepiece. 

        Both objective and eyepiece contribute to the overall magnification.

  <h2 >Resolution of a Microscope </h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/mid/NIHMS363450/"> Resolution of a microscope</a> is its ability to clearly magnify two closeby objects.
    The spatial resolution of a well designed optical microscope is mainly determined 
    by its objective lens and 
    is given by the Rayleigh equation as follows;
$$\Delta r_{0} = 0.62 \frac{\lambda }{n \sin \alpha}$$
where (\(\lambda\)), is the wavelength  of the light source; \(n\) 
is the refractive index of the medium between the specimen and the lens, \(\alpha\) is half-angle 
aperture and \(n \sin \alpha\) is the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens.

          <dt>
              &#160 &#xa0 &#10148 <strong>Resolution of a microscope depends on \(\lambda\) and \(n\) 
                for a microscope of given numeric aperture, NA.</strong>  
         </dt>
     </dl>
  <h3> Practical limitations of a light microscope</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <li>Use of visible light with the wavelength between 390 nm and 790 nm. </li>
    <li>Maximum reachable aperture with the half-angle of 70-75 degree.</li>
    <li>Requirement to use immersion methods with water or oil to increase the refractive index.</li>
  </ul> 
  <dl>
    <dt>
        &#160 &#xa0 &#10148 <strong>Resolution of a conventional light microscope cannot exceed 200 nm.</strong>

  <div id="part5" class="content">
       
    <h2>Electron Microscope</h2>
    <p>As the wavelength of electron beam is much shorter than the visible light in several orders of magnitude,
      the resolution of a microscope using electron beam can reach \(\sim 0.3\) nm. 
      
      For this reason, electron microscope build on the principles of electron optics, has very high magnification 
      power and can image the fine structures of objects.
