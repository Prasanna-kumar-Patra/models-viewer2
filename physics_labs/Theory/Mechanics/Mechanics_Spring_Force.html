          <h2>Spring Force (Hook's Law)</h2>
          <p> In physics, Hooke's law is an empirical law which states that the force, \(F_{s}\) needed to 
            extend a spring by some distance \(d\) scales linearly with respect to that distance,
              $$ \vec{F_{s}} = -k\vec{d}  $$ 
            
           
              where \(k\) is a constant factor characteristic of the spring ((a measure of the spring's stiffness), 
              and \(\vec{d}\) is the displacement of the spring's free end from its position when 
              the spring is in its <b>relaxed state</b> (neither compressed nor
              extended) also \(d\) is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring.

           <h2> Understanding simple harmonic motion (SHM)</h2>
           <div> <iframe src="../Simulations/Mechanics_Spring_Force.html" name="iframe" height="550px" width="100%" style="border:none;" title="simulation"></iframe></div>
          
            <p>
              Any motion that repeats at regular intervals is called periodic motion or harmonic motion. 
              Here we are interested in a periodic motion of simple harmonic motion (SHM) type which can be
              represented using a sinusoidal function of time \(t\). In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the 
              displacement \(x(t)\) of a particle from its equilibrium position is described by the equation
              $$ x = x_{m} \cos(\omega t + \phi) $$
              in which \(x_{m}\) is the amplitude of the displacement, \((\omega t + \phi)\) is
              the phase of the motion, and \(\phi\) is the phase constant. The
              angular frequency \(\omega\) is related to the period and frequency of
              the motion by 
              $$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$$
             
              Differentiating \(x(t)\) leads to equations for the particle's SHM velocity and acceleration 
              as functions of time:
              <p>
                velocity
                $$v = - \omega x_{m} \sin(\omega t + \phi)  $$
              </p>
              <p>
               acceleration
                $$ a = -\omega^{2} x_{m} \cos(\omega t + \phi)  $$
              </p>
              In the velocity function, the positive quantity \(\omega x_{m} \) is the velocity amplitude \(v_{m} \).
              In the acceleration function, the positive quantity \(\omega^{2} x_{m} \) is the acceleration amplitude \(a_{m} \).

              A particle with mass \(m\) that moves under the influence of a
              Hooke's law restoring force given by \(F = -kx\) is a linear simple harmonic 
              oscillator with
              <p>
                Angular frequency,
                $$\omega = \sqrt \frac{k}{m} $$
              </p>
             <p>
               and Time Period,
              $$ T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi\sqrt \frac{m}{k} $$

             The mechanical energy of a linear oscillating spring is given by the sum of 
             potential energy and kinetic energy.
             
             \[E = U(t) + K (t)\]
  
             \[U(t) = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2} = \frac{1}{2}kx_{m}^{2} \cos^{2}(\omega t+\phi) \] 
             \[K(t) = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}x_{m}^{2}\sin^{2}(\omega t +\phi)\]
             where the potential energy and kinetic energy of a linear oscillator are 
             functions of time \(t\)
             <dl>
              <dt>
                  &#160 &#xa0 &#10148  Angular frequency \(\omega = \sqrt \frac{k}{m}\) gives 
                  spring constant \(k=\omega^{2}m\)
                   
             </dt>
            </dl> 
            
            Thus, the mechanical energy in an oscillating spring is
            \[E = \frac{1}{2} kx_{m}^{2} \]

              <dt>
                  &#160 &#xa0 &#10148  The mechanical energy of a linear oscillator is constant and independent of
                  time.
