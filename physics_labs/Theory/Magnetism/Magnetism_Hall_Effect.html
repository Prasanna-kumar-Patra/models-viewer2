            <h2>Hall effect in semiconductors</h2>
            <p>
                When a current-carrying semiconductor is kept in a magnetic field, the charge carriers of the semiconductor experience a force in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. At equilibrium, a voltage appears at the semiconductor edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hall effect allows us to find out whether the charge carriers in the semiconductor are positively or negatively charged (electrons or holes). Beyond that, we can measure the number of such carriers per unit volume of the given semiconductor.

            <h2>Hall Sensor</h2>
            <p>
                A Hall effect sensor (or simply Hall sensor) is a type of sensor which detects the presence and magnitude of a magnetic field using the Hall effect. The output voltage of a Hall sensor is directly proportional to the strength of the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hall sensors are used for proximity sensing, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications
            </p>
            <p>
                Hall Probes are often used as magnetometers,to measure magnetic fields using the principles of magnetic flux.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hall effect devices (when appropriately packaged) are immune to dust, dirt, mud, and water.
